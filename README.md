sciposterpp
===========

This is a package that adds additional macros for sciposter. Here you'll find
sciposterpp package, a few icons and additional tikz blocks. Also, sciposterpp
accepts easibly customizable color themes. Currently, you can already pick three 
color themes out of the box (Dagobah, Korriban and Mandalore).

Feel free to contribute to this repository. I'd be especially gratefull for better 
theme colors, it's easy to write one. If you have used it in your poster and you 
want to share with us the final result, please send me a link.

I have been using this sample poster to develope the package:
https://github.com/thmosqueiro/sciposterpp/blob/master/example/poster.pdf?raw=true

Soon enough I should include more real life examples.


Idea and current status
-----

This package is "somewhat" ready for use as is. I still have some ground 
I want to cover before actually saying it's completely ready. Some friends 
have tested an earlier version, and everything was okay.

My idea: sciposterpp started as a forked class from
sciposter. Currently, it's designed as a package that you add to you
tex whenever you are using sciposter class. This way, everytime
sciposter gets an update, you won't be missing it.

*Tests:* my development is highly based on the texlive-sciposter
package available at the main Fedora repository, marked as version
svn15878.1.18.
