Additional macros for sciposter I use all the time. Here you'll find

experience with sciposter, and a few images that are used by those two
packages as custom buttons.

Feel free to contribute to this repository. If you have used it in
your poster and you want to share with us the ens result, please send

Idea and current status
-----

This package is not yet ready for use, as is. Some friends have tested
it, but they have a complete set of scripts.

My idea: turn it into a single package (.sty) which works with the
last version of scipoter. As you can see, currently I have modified
the an old version of sciposter and this is not good at all.
