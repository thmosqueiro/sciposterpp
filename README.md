sciposterpp
===========

Additional macros for sciposter I use all the time. Here you'll find
sciposterpp package, an additional package, which may enhance your
experience with sciposter, and a few icons that are used by those two
packages as custom buttons.

Feel free to contribute to this repository. If you have used it in
your poster and you want to share with us the ens result, please send
me a link.


Idea and current status
-----

This package is somewhat read for use as is. Some friends have tested
an earlier version, and everything was okay.

My idea: sciposterpp started as a forked class from
sciposter. Currentlu, it's designed as a package that you add to you
tex whenever you are using sciposter class. This way, everytime
sciposter gets an update, you won't be missing it.

*Tests:* my development is highly based on the texlive-sciposter
package available at the main Fedora repository, marked as version
svn15878.1.18.
